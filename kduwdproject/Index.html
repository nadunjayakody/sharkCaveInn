                        <h2>Room Security</h2>
                        <p>There are many different approaches to ensure protection for hotel staff and guests while delivering positive guest experiences at the same time, and in fact, many security systems, procedures, and technologies can be implemented subtly and without dramatically overhauling the structure or ambience of the building.Alongside regular maintenance and the intelligent use of space, technology has a large part to place in hotel security procedures. Modern security systems are discreet and can help improve guest experience while supporting security officers. Video surveillance, digital key cards, and hotel panic buttons are three ways to achieve this.
                            Gas safety is another important consideration, similar to your electricity supply. Your business gas supply and associated appliances should be periodically checked. It's a good idea to arrange annual gas safety checks for any appliances that are serving guest accommodation, even if it’s sited away from the guests’ rooms. </p>
